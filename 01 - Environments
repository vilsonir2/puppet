One great puppet advantage is that you can work with different environments
for example development, operations, tests, and so on
you need to create an structure to accomplish this goal then use it as you like
It provides opportunity to test all the changes before applying to operations environment
You can also save it on GIT and call it when needed
Another item to observe is that you need to run puppet agent instead puppet apply in order to use environments
