In the /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments you willl find the puppet environments

The default environment is production

# Each environment can have an environment.conf file. Its settings will only
# affect its own environment. See docs for more info:
# https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_environment.html


My environment.conf:
modulepath = site:modules:$basemodulepath
manifest = manifests/site.pp

~                             
my site.pp:

node default {
  notify {'This is a production environment!!!':}
}

Run puppet -> it runs the puppet client using the agent installed into the node(in this case the server is the node)
# puppet agent -t

Running a specific environment
# puppet agent -t --environment development

Using the previous created example module, you can copy it inside your environment
# cd modules
# cp -a /..../modules/example .

You can include modules
# vi manifests/site.pp
node default {
  notify {'This is a production environment!!!':}
  include example
}
